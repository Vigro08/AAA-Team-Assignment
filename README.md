# AAA Team Assignment

## Setup
We use uv for python package management.

To succesfully run the code, please install the uv library and create a uv environment with the required packages with the following command: `uv sync`.

Activate the uv environment with:
´source .venv/bin/activate´ (for macOS) or ´.venv\Scripts\activate´ (for Windows)

## Data
The data used for our code can be found on Sciebo: https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/qUceDBn1uTgoB1Z.

There you can find the different stages of datasets that we used (from initial version to final, cleaned versions).
